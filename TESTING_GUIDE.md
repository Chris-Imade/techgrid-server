## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Dashboard shows zeros
**Solution**: Check MongoDB connection string in `.env` file

### Issue: Logo doesn't appear
**Solution**: Verify `/public/assets/logo-white.png` exists and server is serving static files

### Issue: Email not sending
**Solution**: 
1. Check SMTP credentials in `.env`
2. Verify `SMTP_HOST=smtp.ionos.com`
3. Check `SMTP_USER=events@surfspotonline.com`
4. Verify password is correct

### Issue: Colors don't match
**Solution**: Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5) to clear CSS cache
